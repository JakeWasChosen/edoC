## Requirements
- Python 3.8 and up - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- git - https://git-scm.com/download/

### Docker
Docker is an alternative to run the bot 24/7 and always reboot again whenever it crashed. You can find the install manual [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). You don't *have* to get it, but if you're used to having Docker, it's available at least.
```
# Build and run the Dockerfile
docker-compose up -d --build

# Tips on common commands
docker-compose <command>
  ps      Check if bot is online or not (list)
  down    Shut down the bot
  reboot  Reboot the bot without shutting it down or rebuilding
  logs    Check the logs made by the bot.
```
